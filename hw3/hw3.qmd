In this exercise, we use tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, etc) to explore the [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/) data introduced in [homework 1](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2025winter/hw/hw1/hw1.html) and to build a cohort of ICU stays.

## Q1. Visualizing patient trajectory

Visualizing a patient's encounters in a health care system is a common task in clinical data analysis. In this question, we will visualize a patient's ADT (admission-discharge-transfer) history and ICU vitals in the MIMIC-IV data.

### Q1.1 ADT history

A patient's ADT history records the time of admission, discharge, and transfer in the hospital. This figure shows the ADT history of the patient with `subject_id` 10001217 in the MIMIC-IV data. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the type of event (ADT, lab, procedure). The color of the line segment represents the care unit. The size of the line segment represents whether the care unit is an ICU/CCU. The crosses represent lab events, and the shape of the dots represents the type of procedure. The title of the figure shows the patient's demographic information and the subtitle shows top 3 diagnoses.

![](10001217_adt.png) Do a similar visualization for the patient with `subject_id` 10063848 using ggplot.

Hint: We need to pull information from data files `patients.csv.gz`, `admissions.csv.gz`, `transfers.csv.gz`, `labevents.csv.gz`, `procedures_icd.csv.gz`, `diagnoses_icd.csv.gz`, `d_icd_procedures.csv.gz`, and `d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz`. For the big file `labevents.csv.gz`, use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make the Parquet folder `labevents_pq` available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link. Make your code reproducible. 

**Solution:** 
Step 1: Load in required datasets
```{r}
#| eval: false
patients <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz")
admissions <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz")
transfers <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/transfers.csv.gz")
labevents_data <- arrow::open_dataset("~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv", 
                                      format = "csv")
arrow::write_dataset(labevents_data, path = "labevents_pq", format = "parquet")
dataset_parquet <- arrow::open_dataset ("labevents_pq", format = "parquet")
procedures_icd <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/procedures_icd.csv.gz")
diagnoses_icd <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/diagnoses_icd.csv.gz")
d_icd_procedures <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/d_icd_procedures.csv.gz")
d_icd_diagnoses <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz")
```

Step 2: Take a peek of the composition of the data
```{bash}
#| eval: false
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz | head
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | head
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/transfers.csv.gz | head
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz | head
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/procedures_icd.csv.gz | head
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/diagnoses_icd.csv.gz | head
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/d_icd_procedures.csv.gz | head
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz | head 
```

Step 3: Get the required information for patient 10063848
```{r}
#| eval: false

target_id <- 10063848

# read the d_items.csv.gz
items <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz") %>%
  dplyr::select(c(itemid, label, abbreviation)) %>%
  
  # filter the abbreviation with HR, NBPd, NBPs, RR, Temperature F
  dplyr::filter(abbreviation %in% c("HR", "NBPd", "NBPs", "RR",
                                    "Temperature F"))

# define the file path of chartevents.csv
file_path_chartevents <- "~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv"

# read the chartevents.csv.gz
chartevents <- arrow::open_dataset(file_path_chartevents, 
                                   format = "csv") %>%
  
  # filter out ids number of interested vitals
  dplyr::filter(itemid %in% c(220045, 220179, 
                              220180, 220210, 
                              223761)) %>%
  
  # filter the patient with subject_id 10013310
  dplyr::filter(subject_id == target_id) %>%
  
  # exclude unnecessary columns
  dplyr::select(-c(hadm_id, caregiver_id, storetime, warning)) %>%
  collect() %>%
  left_join(items, by = c("itemid" = "itemid"))
```

Step 4: Make the required plot
```{r}

```

### Q1.2 ICU stays

ICU stays are a subset of ADT history. This figure shows the vitals of the patient `10001217` during ICU stays. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the value of the vital. The color of the line represents the type of vital. The facet grid shows the abbreviation of the vital and the stay ID.

![](10001217_icu.png)

Do a similar visualization for the patient `10063848`. 

**Solution:**
Step 1: decompress chartevents.csv.gz
```{bash}
#| eval: false
gzip -d -k ~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv.gz
```
Step 2: take a peek at the data files
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv.gz | head
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz | head
```
Step 3: prepare the data needed
```{r}
#| eval: false
# Define target subject_id
target_id <- 10063848

# Read d_items.csv.gz to get vital sign labels
items <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz") %>%
  dplyr::select(itemid, label, abbreviation) %>%
  dplyr::filter(abbreviation %in% c("HR", "NBPd", "NBPs", "RR", 
                                    "Temperature F"))

# Open chartevents.csv with Arrow for efficient processing
chartevents_data <- arrow::open_dataset("~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv", 
                                        format = "csv")

# Filter and collect only the relevant data
chart_tibble <- chartevents_data %>%
  filter(subject_id == target_id,  
         itemid %in% c(220045, 220181, 220179, 223761, 220210)) %>%
  select(subject_id, charttime, itemid, valuenum) %>%
  collect()  

# Merge with items to get vital sign labels
chart_tibble <- chart_tibble %>%
  left_join(items, by = "itemid")
```
Step 4: plot the plots
```{r}

```
## Q2. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz | head
```

### Q2.1 Ingestion

Import `icustays.csv.gz` as a tibble `icustays_tble`.

```{r}
icustays_tble <- open_dataset("~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz", 
                                     format = "csv") %>% collect()
```

### Q2.2 Summary and visualization

How many unique `subject_id`? Can a `subject_id` have multiple ICU stays? Summarize the number of ICU stays per `subject_id` by graphs.

```{r}
# Count the number of unique subject_id
num_unique_subjects <- icustays_tble %>%
  distinct(subject_id) %>%
  nrow()

cat("Number of unique subject_id:", num_unique_subjects, "\n")

# Count ICU stays per subject_id
icu_stays_per_subject <- icustays_tble %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(num_stays = n())

# Check if a subject_id can have multiple stays
max_stays <- max(icu_stays_per_subject$num_stays)
cat("Maximum ICU stays for a single subject_id:", max_stays, "\n")

# Plot the distribution of ICU stays per subject_id
ggplot(icu_stays_per_subject, aes(x = num_stays)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of ICU Stays per Subject",
       x = "Number of ICU Stays",
       y = "Count of Subjects") +
  theme_minimal()

```

Yes, a single subject_id can have multiple stays and the maximum ICU stays for a single subject_id is 41.

## Q3. `admissions` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `admissions.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | head
```

### Q3.1 Ingestion

Import `admissions.csv.gz` as a tibble `admissions_tble`. **Solution:**

```{r}
admissions_tble <- open_dataset("~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz",
  format = "csv") %>% collect()
```

### Q3.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize the following information by graphics and explain any patterns you see.

-   number of admissions per patient\
-   admission hour (anything unusual?)\
-   admission minute (anything unusual?)\
-   length of hospital stay (from admission to discharge) (anything unusual?)

According to the [MIMIC-IV documentation](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/about/concepts/#date-shifting),

All dates in the database have been shifted to protect patient confidentiality. Dates will be internally consistent for the same patient, but randomly distributed in the future. Dates of birth which occur in the present time are not true dates of birth. Furthermore, dates of birth which occur before the year 1900 occur if the patient is older than 89. In these cases, the patient’s age at their first admission has been fixed to 300. **Solution:**

```{r}
# Convert datetime columns to proper format
admissions_tble <- admissions_tble %>%
  mutate(admittime = as.POSIXct(admittime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
         dischtime = as.POSIXct(dischtime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))

# ---- 1. Number of Admissions per Patient ----
admissions_per_patient <- admissions_tble %>%
  count(subject_id)

# Plot the distribution of admissions per patient
ggplot(admissions_per_patient, aes(x = n)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Number of Admissions per Patient",
       x = "Admissions",
       y = "Number of Patients") +
  theme_minimal()

# ---- 2. Admission Hour Analysis ----
admissions_tble <- admissions_tble %>%
  mutate(admission_hour = hour(admittime))

# Plot admission hour distribution
ggplot(admissions_tble, aes(x = admission_hour)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "red", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Admission Hour Distribution",
       x = "Hour of Admission",
       y = "Number of Admissions") +
  theme_minimal()

# ---- 3. Admission Minute Analysis ----
admissions_tble <- admissions_tble %>%
  mutate(admission_minute = minute(admittime))

# Plot admission minute distribution
ggplot(admissions_tble, aes(x = admission_minute)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "purple", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Admission Minute Distribution",
       x = "Minute of Admission",
       y = "Number of Admissions") +
  theme_minimal()

# ---- 4. Length of Hospital Stay ----
admissions_tble <- admissions_tble %>%
  mutate(length_of_stay_days = as.numeric(difftime(dischtime, admittime, units="days")))

# Plot the distribution of hospital stay length
ggplot(admissions_tble, aes(x = length_of_stay_days)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "green", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Hospital Stay Length Distribution",
       x = "Length of Stay (Days)",
       y = "Number of Patients") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Q4. `patients` data

Patient information is available in `patients.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz | head
```

### Q4.1 Ingestion

Import `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/>) as a tibble `patients_tble`. **Solution:**

```{r}
patients_tble <- open_dataset(sources = "~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz", 
  format = "csv") %>% dplyr::collect()
```

### Q4.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize variables `gender` and `anchor_age` by graphics, and explain any patterns you see.

```{r}
# Import the CSV file as a tibble
patients_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz")

# Summary of gender as a bar chart
ggplot(patients_tble, aes(x = gender)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

# Summary of anchor_age as a histogram
ggplot(patients_tble, aes(x = anchor_age)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "tomato", bins = 30, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Anchor Age", x = "Anchor Age", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

# Boxplot for anchor_age by gender
ggplot(patients_tble, aes(x = gender, y = anchor_age, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution by Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Anchor Age") +
  theme_minimal()
```

According to the bar chart of gender distribution, we can see a relatively balanced number of male and female subjects, suggesting that the data is representative across genders without a significant skew.

According to the histogram of anchor age, the distribution is not uniform with a notable spike in younger groups, particularly around early adulthood (20–30 years old) and some fluctuation across the middle to elder aged groups (around 40 to 85 years old).

According to the boxplot of age distribution by gender, both genders shows similar median anchor ages. The IQR range of male is slightly smaller than that of female.

## Q5. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_labitems.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/d_labitems/>) is the dictionary of lab measurements.

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine (50912), potassium (50971), sodium (50983), chloride (50902), bicarbonate (50882), hematocrit (51221), white blood cell count (51301), and glucose (50931). Retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` that only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the last available measurement (by `storetime`) before the ICU stay. The final `labevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each lab measurement.

![](labevents_tble.png) Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `labevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link.

**Solution:**
Step 1: Save the icustays.csv.gz, d_labitems.csv.gz files (including the lab measurement that we are interested in), and labevents.csv.gz as tibbles  
```{r}
# define the target items
target_items <- c(50912, 50971, 
                  50983, 50902, 
                  50882, 51221, 
                  51301, 50931)

# load the icustays.csv.gz file
icustays_tble <- arrow::open_dataset("~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz", 
                                     format = "csv") %>%
  collect() %>%
  print(width = Inf)

# load the d_labitems.csv.gz file
dlabitems_tble <- arrow::open_dataset("~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz", 
                                      format = "csv") %>%
  filter(itemid %in% target_items) %>%
  collect() %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```
Step 2: Save the labevents.csv.gz file as a tibble and filter the rows with the the items that we are interested in and the patients in icustays_tble
```{r}
labevents_tble <- arrow::open_dataset('labevents_pq', 
                                 format = "parquet") %>%
  # select the columns of interest
  select(subject_id, itemid, storetime, valuenum) %>%
  filter(itemid %in% target_items) %>%
  filter(subject_id %in% icustays_tble$subject_id) %>%
  collect() %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```
Step 3: Finsh up the rest of the problem
```{r}
# Define the file name for caching
cache_file <- "labevents_tble.rds"

# Check if cached file exists
if (file.exists(cache_file)) {
  labevents_tble <- read_rds(cache_file) %>% print(width = Inf)
} else {
  
  # Load ICU Stay Data
  icustays_tble <- arrow::open_dataset("~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz", 
                                       format = "csv") %>%
    select(subject_id, stay_id, intime) %>% collect() %>%
    mutate(intime = as.POSIXct(intime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))

  # Load & Filter Labevents Before Collecting
  target_items <- c(50912, 50971, 50983, 50902, 50882, 51221, 51301, 50931)

  labevents_data <- arrow::open_dataset("labevents_pq", format = "parquet") %>%
    filter(itemid %in% target_items) %>%
    select(subject_id, itemid, storetime, valuenum)

  # Pre-filter to only ICU patients using Arrow before collecting
  icustay_subjects <- unique(icustays_tble$subject_id)  
  labevents_filtered <- labevents_data %>%
    filter(subject_id %in% icustay_subjects) %>% collect() %>%
    mutate(storetime = as.POSIXct(storetime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))

  # Join ICU Stays FIRST to Prevent Many-to-Many
  labevents_joined <- labevents_filtered %>%
    left_join(icustays_tble, by = "subject_id") %>%
    filter(storetime <= intime) %>% 
    group_by(subject_id, stay_id, itemid) %>%
    slice_max(order_by = storetime, n = 1) %>% ungroup() %>%
    select(-storetime, -intime)

  # Convert to Wide Format
  labevents_tble <- labevents_joined %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = itemid, values_from = valuenum) %>%
    
    # Rename columns to meaningful names
    rename(creatinine = `50912`, 
           potassium = `50971`, 
           sodium = `50983`, 
           chloride = `50902`,
           bicarbonate = `50882`, 
           hematocrit = `51221`, 
           white_blood_cell_count = `51301`, 
           glucose = `50931`)

  # Save the final table for future use
  write_rds(labevents_tble, cache_file)

  # Print the final processed table
  print(labevents_tble, width = Inf)
}
```

## Q6. Vitals from charted events

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `itemid` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `value` variable is the value measured for `itemid`. The first 10 lines of `chartevents.csv.gz` are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `itemid` in `chartevents.csv.gz`.

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate (220045), systolic non-invasive blood pressure (220179), diastolic non-invasive blood pressure (220180), body temperature in Fahrenheit (223761), and respiratory rate (220210). Retrieve a subset of `chartevents.csv.gz` only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the first vital measurement within the ICU stay. The final `chartevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each vital measurement.

![](chartevents_tble.png)

Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `chartevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory, for example, by a symbolic link.

```{r}
#| eval: false

```

## Q7. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble `mimic_icu_cohort` for all ICU stays, where rows are all ICU stays of adults (age at `intime` \>= 18) and columns contain at least following variables

-   all variables in `icustays_tble`\
-   all variables in `admissions_tble`\
-   all variables in `patients_tble`
-   the last lab measurements before the ICU stay in `labevents_tble`
-   the first vital measurements during the ICU stay in `chartevents_tble`

The final `mimic_icu_cohort` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each variable.

![](mimic_icu_cohort.png) 

**Solution:**
```{r}

```
## Q8. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Summarize the following information about the ICU stay cohort `mimic_icu_cohort` using appropriate numerics or graphs:

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs demographic variables (race, insurance, marital_status, gender, age at intime)

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs the last available lab measurements before ICU stay

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs the first vital measurements within the ICU stay

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs first ICU unit
